## I am Hudson, a full stack developer and programmer.
As a developer and designer for the Aardvark programming language, I work with all sorts of frameworks, building all from web apps to programming languages.
In addition to Aardvark, I build 2d and 3d video games, end-to-end encrypted messaging apps, search engines, discord bots, and much much more.

## Projects
### Aardvark
Aardvark is a high-level general-purpose programming language built for ease and speed. It's meant to be easier than Python and faster than C. We are constantly working to reach these two goals. We are currently working on the compiler, which will compile to LLVM (just like C and C++). It can be found [here](https://github.com/Aardvark-team/Aardvark).
