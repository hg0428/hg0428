### Aardvark
Aardvark is a high-level general-purpose programming language built for ease and speed. It's meant to be easier than Python and faster than C. We are constantly working to reach these two goals. We are currently working on the compiler, which will compile to LLVM (just like C and C++). It can be found [here](https://github.com/Aardvark-team/Aardvark-py).
